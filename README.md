## Game objective
There are 8 pairs of cards with matching images.

To win the game, match the 8 pairs of cards.

## How to play
Click each card to reveal the image.

When you have one pair open, if the images match, the cards stay open and you can try to find the other matches.

If the images don't match, the cards will close and you can try again to find any matches.

When you click the first card, a timer will start and the game will show your number of moves.

At the end, you will receive a star rating based on your number of moves:
* 3 stars: less than 25 moves
* 2 stars: 25-32 moves
* 1 star: more than 32 moves
